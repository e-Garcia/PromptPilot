### 🧑‍✈️ Creator & Lead Maintainer
- **Erick Josue Gabriel Garcia Garcia** (<erick@egarcia.dev>)  
  Creator of PromptPilot. Led plugin architecture, modular backend design, and IntelliJ/Android Studio integration. Maintains the project vision, code reviews, and release pipeline.

> *To the best of my knowledge as of April 2025, PromptPilot is the first open-source IntelliJ plugin specifically designed for Android Studio that enables multi-backend AI prompt orchestration for code generation workflows.*
> *(Based on review of GitHub, JetBrains Marketplace, and public developer forums — no similar plugin was found at the time of creation.)*
